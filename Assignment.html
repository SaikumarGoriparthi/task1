    <p>Sir Charles Spencer Chaplin KBE (16 April 1889 – 25 December 1977) was an English comic actor, filmmaker, and composer who rose to fame in the era of silent film. He became a worldwide icon through his screen persona, the Tramp, and is considered one of the film industry's most important figures. His career spanned more than 75 years, from childhood in the Victorian era until a year before his death in 1977, and encompassed both adulation and controversy.

        Chaplin's childhood in London was one of poverty and hardship. His father was absent and his mother struggled financially—he was sent to a workhouse twice before age nine. When he was 14, his mother was committed to a mental asylum. Chaplin began performing at an early age, touring music halls and later working as a stage actor and comedian. At 19, he was signed to the Fred Karno company, which took him to the United States. He was scouted for the film industry and began appearing in 1914 for Keystone Studios. He soon introduced and adopted the Tramp as his screen persona. He directed his own films and continued to hone his craft as he moved to Essanay Studios, where the Tramp persona was developed emotionally in The Tramp (1915). He then attracted a large fanbase and demanded more money as he moved to Mutual and First National corporations. By 1918, he was one of the world's well-paid and best-known figures.

    <p>Charles Spencer Chaplin Jr. was born on 16 April 1889 to Hannah Chaplin (née Hill) and Charles Chaplin Sr. His paternal grandmother came from the Smith family, who belonged to Romani people.[1][2][3][4] There is no official record of his birth, although Chaplin believed he was born at East Street, Walworth, in South London.[5][a] His parents had married four years previously, at which time Charles Sr. became the legal guardian of Hannah's first son, Sydney John Hill.[9][b] At the time of his birth, Chaplin's parents were both music hall entertainers. Hannah, the daughter of a shoemaker,[10] had a brief and unsuccessful career under the stage name Lily Harley,[11] while Charles Sr., a butcher's son,[12] was a popular singer.[13] Although they never divorced, Chaplin's parents were estranged by around 1891.[14] The following year, Hannah gave birth to a third son, George Wheeler Dryden, fathered by the music hall entertainer Leo Dryden. The child was taken by Dryden at six months old, and did not re-enter Chaplin's life for thirty years.[15]

        Chaplin's childhood was fraught with poverty and hardship, making his eventual trajectory "the most dramatic of all the rags to riches stories ever told" according to his authorised biographer David Robinson.[17] Chaplin's early years were spent with his mother and brother Sydney in the London district of Kennington. Hannah had no means of income, other than occasional nursing and dressmaking, and Chaplin Sr. provided no financial support.[18] As the situation deteriorated, Chaplin was sent to Lambeth Workhouse when he was seven years old.[c] The council housed him at the Central London District School for paupers, which Chaplin remembered as "a forlorn existence".[20] He was briefly reunited with his mother 18 months later, but Hannah was forced to readmit her family to the workhouse in July 1898. The boys were promptly sent to Norwood Schools, another institution for destitute children.[21]

        In September 1898, Hannah was committed to Cane Hill mental asylum; she had developed a psychosis seemingly brought on by an infection of syphilis and malnutrition.[22] For the two months she was there, Chaplin and his brother Sydney were sent to live with their father, whom the young boys scarcely knew.[23] Charles Sr. was by then severely alcoholic, and life there was bad enough to provoke a visit from the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children.[24] Chaplin's father died two years later, at 38 years old, from cirrhosis of the liver.[25]

        Hannah entered a period of remission but, in May 1903, became ill again.[24] Chaplin, then 14, had the task of taking his mother to the infirmary, from where she was sent back to Cane Hill.[26] He lived alone for several days, searching for food and occasionally sleeping rough, until Sydney – who had joined the Navy two years earlier – returned.[27] Hannah was released from the asylum eight months later,[28] but in March 1905, her illness returned, this time permanently. "There was nothing we could do but accept poor mother's fate", Chaplin later wrote, and she remained in care until her death in 1928.[29]

    <p>Chaplin soon found work with a new company and went on tour with his brother, who was also pursuing an acting career, in a comedy sketch called Repairs.[45] In May 1906, Chaplin joined the juvenile act Casey's Circus,[46] where he developed popular burlesque pieces and was soon the star of the show. By the time the act finished touring in July 1907, the 18-year-old had become an accomplished comedic performer.[47] He struggled to find more work, however, and a brief attempt at a solo act was a failure.[g]

        Meanwhile, Sydney Chaplin had joined Fred Karno's prestigious comedy company in 1906 and, by 1908, he was one of their key performers.[49] In February, he managed to secure a two-week trial for his younger brother. Karno was initially wary, and considered Chaplin a "pale, puny, sullen-looking youngster" who "looked much too shy to do any good in the theatre".[50] However, the teenager made an impact on his first night at the London Coliseum and he was quickly signed to a contract.[51] Chaplin began by playing a series of minor parts, eventually progressing to starring roles in 1909.[52] In April 1910, he was given the lead in a new sketch, Jimmy the Fearless. It was a big success, and Chaplin received considerable press attention.[53]

        Karno selected his new star to join the section of the company that toured North America's vaudeville circuit, a section which also included Stan Laurel.[54][55] The young comedian headed the show and impressed reviewers, being described as "one of the best pantomime artists ever seen here".[56] His most successful role was a drunk called the "Inebriate Swell", which drew him significant recognition.[57] The tour lasted 21 months, and the troupe returned to England in June 1912.[58] Chaplin recalled that he "had a disquieting feeling of sinking back into a depressing commonplaceness" and was, therefore, delighted when a new tour began in October.[59]

    <p>In January 1918, Chaplin was visited by leading British singer and comedian Harry Lauder, and the two acted in a short film together.[120]

        Mutual was patient with Chaplin's decreased rate of output, and the contract ended amicably. With his aforementioned concern about the declining quality of his films because of contract scheduling stipulations, Chaplin's primary concern in finding a new distributor was independence; Sydney Chaplin, then his business manager, told the press: "Charlie [must] be allowed all the time he needs and all the money for producing [films] the way he wants ... It is quality, not quantity, we are after."[121] In June 1917, Chaplin signed to complete eight films for First National Exhibitors' Circuit in return for $1 million.[r][122] He chose to build his own studio, situated on five acres of land off Sunset Boulevard, with production facilities of the highest order.[123] Charlie Chaplin Studios was completed in January 1918,[124] and Chaplin was given freedom over the making of his pictures.[125]

        A Dog's Life, released April 1918, was the first film under the new contract. In it, Chaplin demonstrated his increasing concern with story construction and his treatment of the Tramp as "a sort of Pierrot".[126] The film was described by Louis Delluc as "cinema's first total work of art".[127] Chaplin then embarked on the Third Liberty Bond campaign, touring the United States for one month to raise money for the Allies of the First World War.[128] He also produced a short propaganda film at his own expense, donated to the government for fund-raising, called The Bond.[129] Chaplin's next release was war-based, placing the Tramp in the trenches for Shoulder Arms. Associates warned him against making a comedy about the war but, as he later recalled: "Dangerous or not, the idea excited me."[130] He spent four months filming the picture, which was released in October 1918 with great success.[131]
